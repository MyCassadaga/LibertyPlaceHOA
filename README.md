# Liberty Place HOA Management Platform (Phase 1)

Phase 1 of the Liberty Place HOA portal modernises core self-managed board tasks: homeowner directory, billing, basic communications, contract storage, and foundational RBAC/audit logging. The project ships as a FastAPI backend with a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm (or pnpm/yarn if preferred)
- SQLite (bundled with Python) for local development

## Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Apply database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 4. (One-time) create the initial SYSADMIN user
python backend/manage_create_admin.py --email admin@example.com --password changeme
python -m backend.manage_create_admin …
# 5. Run the FastAPI development server
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API is served at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs live at `/docs`.

## Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Default Roles & Access

Roles are seeded at startup (`SYSADMIN`, `BOARD`, `TREASURER`, `SECRETARY`, `ARC`, `AUDITOR`, `ATTORNEY`, `HOMEOWNER`). RBAC gates routers and actions based on minimum privileges. All sensitive operations create audit log entries.

## Initial Data Flow

1. Seed roles and create the first SYSADMIN using the management script.
2. SYSADMIN registers additional board, treasurer, and homeowner users through the `/auth/register` endpoint.
3. Board/Treasurer users populate homeowners, contracts, and invoices via API endpoints (or Postman) until UI forms are added in later phases.
4. Homeowners log in to view invoices, request profile updates, and receive announcements generated by board members.

## Repository Layout

```
backend/        FastAPI app, SQLAlchemy models, services, Alembic migrations
frontend/       React + Vite + Tailwind UI
  src/pages     Feature pages (dashboard, billing, owners, contracts, communications)
  src/hooks     Client-side auth context
  src/services  REST API client
  src/components Layout and auth guards
  src/styles    Tailwind entry point
migrations/     Alembic migration scripts (inside backend/migrations)
docs/           Phase scope and extended documentation
```

## Tests & Next Steps

- Add automated tests (pytest) once domain logic solidifies.
- Integrate a production-grade email/PDF provider in place of the current stubs.
- Implement 2FA and persistent session storage as outlined in the full spec.
